# DiscordMinesweeperScript
This basic nodejs script will allow you to create a 10x10 15x15 or if you really want to a 50x50 grid.

The usage is quite simple.

You will need *NodeJS* [Link](https://nodejs.org/en/) and the three files in this repository.

**Optional:** If you want a different size of the minesweeper field other than the 10Ã—10 default, just go ahead and change this line in the run.js `var gridSize = 10;` and if you want more or less mines change this line `var maxMines = 15;` which is directly under the gridSize variable in the run.js

After you done setting up nodejs and / or changed the variables to your needs you can generate the field using `node run.js`

The output can then directly pasted into discord.
